Multirobot systems are established research area within robotics and artificial intelligence with growing number of applications. A multirobot system can improve effectiveness in terms of both performance and robustness over a single robot. A team of robots can also solve tasks that can not be tackled by a single robot. Multirobot systems can scale to large environments and to the most demanding applications.

Multirobot systems have been deployed to several application domains including space exploration~\citep{goldberg2002distributedspace,huntsberger2003campout}, autonomous patrolling~\citep{parker2003parolling100}, disaster rescue and victim search, aerial surveillance, unmanned delivery, mine cleaning, snow removal~\citep{choset2001coverage}, assembly of large-scale buildings or planetary habitat~\citep{goldberg2002distributedspace} and robotic football~\citep{asada1999robocup}. Those applications require robots to operate in  dynamic environments, with high degree of uncertainty and external changes caused by other robots, humans and other agents that are not part of the multirobot system itself.

To be able to solve such demanding problems multirobot systems rely on distributed planning, communication and control algorithms. This work presents an algorithm for estimating positions of the robots in the shared environment and for building the global map of the environment (map-merging) without any previous knowledge or assumptions about the environment. Knowledge of positions of the robots and the map of the environment are crucial elements for effective collaborative planning and coordination. While multirobot systems that don't have knowledge of the presence of other robots has been developed, \citet{farinelli2004multirobot} lists such systems as \textit{unaware systems}, these systems are normally used only for very simple tasks~\citep{farinelli2004multirobot}. For most of the multirobot systems knowledge of positions of robots is essential and map-merging is a key problem to solve.

A typical multirobot system consists of many software parts typically structured in a multi-layer architecture. The implementation presented in this work leverages modularity of the widely-used \gls{ROS} framework and respects community established standards. This allows easy integration with existing planning, mapping and communication algorithms enabling quick development of multirobot systems suited for the particular task.

Chapter~\ref{chap:analysis} of this work discusses related works and various approaches to estimation of robots positions in unknown environment. Chapter~\ref{chap:mergingalgorithm} introduces the presented map-merging algorithm. Chapter~\ref{chap:implementation} presents implementation of the developed map-merging algorithm for the \gls{ROS} framework. Chapter~\ref{chap:evaluation} accesses performance of the implementation using several standard robotic datasets and experiments done by the author. Documentation for the \gls{ROS} implementation is attached as appendix~\ref{chap:map_merge-wiki}.
